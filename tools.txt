- dash: bring plotly to the web (aka the frontend)
- plotly: graphing library (charts, etc) - better than matplotlib I would say as this integrates with dash and we will need a frontend...
- pandas: data analysis library
- scrapy: for webcrawlers
- psycopg2: adapter SQL (postgresql)
- SQLAlchemy: object relational mapper (abstract away from sql code)
- Database: postgresql: why? fast, good with finance stuff
