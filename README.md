Supported Platforms
===================
Windows & Linux

Dependencies
============
* Python 3: Ensure it is installed in your `PATH` environment variable. 
  To check run `python --version` from your Terminal (Linux) or your Power Shell (Windows). The version
  must be 3.5.X or higher.
* Chrome Driver (required due to `selenium`)
    * Chrome might be sufficient, depending on your OS
    * Ensure it is installed in your `PATH` environment variable  
    * Other drivers (Firefox, ...) are not yet supported
    * [Driver installation details](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)
* A local or remote database that is [compatible](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/features.html) with *SQLAlchemy*. 
    *PostgreSQL* is strongly recommended as it is the only one tested.
    * Arch Linux [setup guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL) (most steps should also be applicable to other `systemd` based distributions)
    * In Fedora there is one quirk: make sure you change `pg_hba.conf` as described in this [answer](https://support.plesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024041714-Unable-to-change-PostgreSQL-admin-password-or-log-in-to-PostgreSQL-on-Plesk-psql-FATAL-Ident-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres-)
    * Windows [setup guide](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/)
* On Linux: Ensure you have installed `de_DE` and `en_US` languages. 
  Not sure yet if and what is required on Windows.
  
Developer Installation
======================

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/armbruer/etfoptimizer.git`
2. a) On Linux Distributions:
    * Change directory into project folder: `cd etfoptimizer`
    * Set up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with 
      `python3 -m venv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate` and run `python3 -m pip install -U pip wheel setuptools`
    * Always activate your virtual environment first (with `source ./venv/bin/activate`) then you can install
      the command line tool (including the changes you made) using `pip install --editable=.`
    * Now check if your installation succeeded by running `etfopt`. The output should show the help page of this tool.
2. b) On Windows: TODO Ruben    

User Installation
=================

1. Install the wheel package: `pip install wheel --user`.
2. Download a packaged version of `etfoptimizer` from tbd.
3. Install `etfoptimizer` using `pip install <download location> --user`

    
Post-Installation Setup (Required for Users and Developers)
===========================================================
1. Make sure you have installed all dependencies, downloaded the repository and installed its python dependencies.
2. Create a new database, e.g. for Linux and PostgreSQL:
    1. Log in as `postgres` user (default user) by running `su` and `su -l postgres`
    2. Run `createdb <database name>` to create the database
3. The database connection:
   Either navigate from the project working directory to `ÃˆTFOptimizer/settings.py` and change the `SQL_URI` parameter.
   The required format for this step is: `SQL_URI = 'postgresql+psycopg2://<user>:<password>:<port>/<database name>'`.
   
   Or run directly `python3 run_crawlers.py setupdb` which will guide you though the database connection setup.

Data retrieval
==============

This project distinguishes for the ETF data into two classes, the first one being the `static data class`, which never changes 
(or at least only very rarely) and the second one being the `dynamic data class`, which contains the daily/monthly prices 
and other dynamic data of the ETFs.

First, you need to retrieve the static data. For this, we strongly recommend running our interactive crawler by typing
`python3 run_crawlers.py runi`. Please note, this will ask you whether you want to delete all static data. 
Deleting the static data is only required if you wish to rerun crawlers, as mentioned previously some static data might 
prone to change over long times. Deleting does not hurt, if you run this for the first time, as no previous data is available. 
Please answer each question with `y` in order to download all static data. This might take up to 15 minutes.

TODO second step Ruben

Packaging Instructions
======================

1. Activate your virtual environment `source ./venv/bin/activate`.
2. Package the project `python setup.py bdist_wheel`.
3. Upload to TDB.
